# CSI2300
This repository contains files for a semester-long project in an "Introduction to Data Science" course at Baylor University.

The instructor for my fall 2024 section of CSI 2300 is Dr. Rachel Wilkerson.

The data for this project is available online: https://data.cdc.gov/Teen-Vaccinations/Vaccination-Coverage-among-Adolescents-13-17-Years/ee48-w5t6.

Additional information was compiled from United States government websites.

Currently, I am using a runtime on Google Colab, but for my final submission, I will create an R Markdown file.
