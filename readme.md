# Vaccination

This repository contains files for a semester-long project in an "Introduction to Data Science" course at Baylor University.

Furthermore, this is also work for a graduate student, who intends to publish a paper related to this analysis.

Everyone is aware that I am doing this for research and for coursework.

The instructor for my fall 2024 section of CSI 2300 is Dr. Rachel Wilkerson.

The data for this project is available online: https://data.cdc.gov/Teen-Vaccinations/Vaccination-Coverage-among-Adolescents-13-17-Years/ee48-w5t6.

Additional information was compiled from United States government websites.

Currently, I am using a runtime on Google Colab, but for my final submission, I will create an R Markdown file.
